Clustering Algortihms
In Machine Learning, the types of Learning can broadly be classified into three types:

Supervised Learning,
Unsupervised Learning and
Semi-supervised Learning.
Algorithms belonging to the family of Unsupervised Learning have no variable to predict tied to the data. Instead of having an output, the data only has an input which would be multiple variables that describe the data. This is where clustering comes in.

Clustering is the task of grouping together a set of objects in a way that objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to objects in other clusters. Similarity is a metric that reflects the strength of relationship between two data objects. Clustering is mainly used for exploratory data mining. It has manifold usage in many fields such as machine learning, pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bio-informatics, data compression, and computer graphics.

K-Means
There are many models for clustering out there. We will be going through most popular ones. Despite its simplicity, the K-means is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from unlabeled data. In this notebook, we see how to use k-Means for customer segmentation.
